# RoboRally Game Implementation

This repository is the server for a computer implementation of the board game RoboRally. It is written in Java and our client repository uses JavaFX for the graphical user interface.

## Prerequisites for playing RoboRally

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- You have installed a recent version of Java (Java 21 is used during development, so it is recommended).

## Running RoboRally

To run the RoboRally Server (which must run before the client has any playability), follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal in the project root directory.
2. Run the program using the following command:
    ```bash
    java -jar RoboRallyServer.jar
    ```
